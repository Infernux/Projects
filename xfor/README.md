xfor
====

xfor (old name multifor) is a new control structure created by Camus (https://team.inria.fr/camus/ibb/) I worked on during my internship in Strasbourg.
The goal was to find a way to try out xfor before the compiler needed to create program using it is incorporated into the usuals compilers.
The idea was to simulate the action of xfor (what would be done during the compilation with xfor), but during the execution while using macros (in order to be more transparent to the user).
