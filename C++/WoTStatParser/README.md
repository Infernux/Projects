The idea behind this project was to create a program able to display stats gathered from the cache file from World Of Tanks.  
The main problem, which was by far the funniest part, was the parsing. Why was it interesting ?  
Cause you first have to unpickle the file (python), then try to understand how the file is architected.  
Thanks to the %!xxd command from Vi, I managed to look at the hexa file in order to find and understand how it was created.  
A really good training for hexa reading.
