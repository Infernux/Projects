Sms2Pad
=======
I was kinda annoyed by the fact that it was (and still, for now 28/08/14) impossible to send and receive SMS from an Android tablet while having an Android phone.
Which was possible with WebOS (one of the greatest mobile OS).
I decided to create my own app, had to learn of to use Threads/Bluetooth/Android database for messages/Services.
